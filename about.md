<p>As a Machine Learning Engineer, my expertise lies primarily in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and sequence models. I am an aspiring deep learning researcher who thrives on connecting the dots - whether they are ideas from diverse disciplines, people from different teams, or applications across various industries. My strong technical skills are backed by an academic foundation in engineering, statistics, and machine learning.

<p>My passion is to create impactful machine learning and computer vision technologies that solve real-world business problems. I excel in communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders and have the ability to adapt across verticals to deliver high-performing AI solutions.

<p>Currently, I am serving as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Quantiphi, where I am responsible for creating and maintaining models, as well as onboarding new datasets.

<p>Outside of work, I am an adventurous traveler who has explored 26 cities and counting. I am also an avid football enthusiast.

<p>I enjoy meeting new people over a cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out to me at harshavk97@gmail.com or send me a DM on Instagram at @_harshav.
